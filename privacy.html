            <div class="faq-item" id="faq-1">
                <h3>Does the tool send uploaded data to ChatGPT or any public AI training databases?</h3>
                <p>
                    The tool sends selected content (e.g., sentences or sections) to large language models via API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude) 
                    for analysis. We do not use these services in a way that contributes to model training or public databases. However, inputs 
                    and outputs may be retained by the provider (e.g., OpenAI) for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring, before being permanently deleted.
                </p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>If I upload a sensitive research document, is it safe from being shared or used elsewhere?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Your files are processed in isolated, controlled environments. By default, the tool stores intermediate processing data 
                    (such as sentence-level text and structure) for up to 30 days to support reproducibility and debugging. You can also request 
                    immediate deletion after each session.
                </p>

                <h3>Where is the data processed – and does that matter under GDPR?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, it matters – and we've accounted for that. The tool is hosted on Microsoft Azure in Europe (region: North Europe), 
                    and we ensure that all data processing and storage stay within the European Economic Area (EEA) to comply with GDPR and 
                    institutional data protection requirements.

                <h3>What measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access?</h3>
                <p>
                    We use enterprise-grade security practices from Microsoft Azure, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Role-based access control</li>
                    <li>Encrypted data transfers and storage</li>
                    <li>Audit logging (optional per institution)</li>
                    <li>Isolation between user sessions and data</li>

            <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
            <p>
                The DMP Analysis Tool collects and processes the text you submit for analysis. This data is used solely 
                for the purpose of providing you with analysis results and recommendations for your Data Management Plan.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
                Analysis results are stored in our database with a unique identifier. These results may be retained for 
                up to 30 days to allow you to access your analysis results and export them as PDF documents. You can request 
                immediate deletion of your data after each session.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, 
                disclosure, or destruction. All data is processed using secure connections and stored in protected databases 
                within the European Economic Area (EEA).
            </p>
            
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                Our tool utilizes third-party AI services (such as OpenAI or Anthropic/Claude) for text analysis. These services 
                are bound by their own privacy policies and data processing agreements that ensure the confidentiality of your data.
                Data sent to these services may be retained by the provider for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring purposes before 
                being permanently deleted.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data. If you wish to exercise 
                these rights, please contact the system administrator.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
